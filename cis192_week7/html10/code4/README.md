Do the following:
## Tasks
Open the files *code10-4.html* and *debug10-4.js* and in the comment section enter your **name** **(First + Last)** and the **date** (**MM/DD/YYYY**) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields of each file.

Open the *code10-4.html* file and within the ```head``` section insert a ```script``` element connecting the page to the *debug10-4.js* file. Add the ```defer``` attribute to the ```script``` element.

Open the *debug10-4.js* file and fix the syntax errors in the following locations to allow the code to run correctly (there are no logic errors in the code):

1. Fix the statement that declares the ```thisDay```variable.
2. Fix the statement that declares the ```monthName```variable.
3. Fix the ```for``` loop that calls the ```writeMonthTable()``` function.
4. Fix the code that writes the value of the ```htmlCode```variable into the element with ID **calendar**.
5. Fix the three ```if``` statements found within the ```writeMonthTable()``` function

Open the website in the browser preview. When the page is free of errors, you should see a calendar for the current year with the current day highlighted on the page.
