Do the following:
## Tasks
    
Save code2-1_txt.html as code2-1.html. Save code2-1_txt.css as code2-1.css. Open the files *code2-1.html* and *code2-1.css* and in the comment section enter your**name** (First + Last) and the **date** (MM/DD/YYYY) into the ```Author:``` and```Date:``` fields of each file.

Go to the *code2-1.html* file and within the```head``` section insert a```link``` element linking the page to the *code2-1.css* file. Review the contents.
                
Link the CSS file to the HTML file

In the *code2-1.css* file create a style rule for the ```h1``` element that sets the ```font-size``` property to **3.5em** and sets the ```line-height``` property to **0em**.
                
Create a style rule for ```h1``` and ```h2``` elements that applies the fonts **Helvetica**, **Arial** **sans-serif** to the ```font-family``` property and sets the ```letter-spacing``` property to **0.1em**.

Create a style rule for the ```blockquote``` element that sets the ```color``` property to the value **hsl(30, 85%, 45%)** and sets the ```font-size``` property to **1.5em**. Also, create a style for the first letter of the ```blockquote``` element that sets the ```font-size``` property to **1.5em** (watch what happens).

Create a style for the ```footer``` element that:

1. Centers the text by setting the ```text-align``` property to **center**,
2. Sets the ```font-size``` property to **2em**,
3. Sets the ```color``` property to **white**, and
4. Sets the ```background-color``` property to the color value **hsl(30, 85%, 45%)**.

Open the *code2-1.html* file in browser preview, verifying that the page resembles that shown in *Figure 2-54* (aside from the line length which depends on the width of your browser window.)
