<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Cauli-Wood Gallery</strong> - Sofia Fonte is the manager of the Cauli-Wood Gallery, an art gallery and coffee shop located in Sedona, Arizona. She has approached you for help in redesigning the gallery&rsquo;s website to include support for mobile devices and tablets. Your first project will be to redesign the site&rsquo;s home page following the principles of responsive design. A preview of the mobile and desktop versions of the website&rsquo;s home page is shown in <em>Figure 5&ndash;64</em>.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/9dEAXNZ3QvOAgo3yb7Ot" alt="Two screenshots displays a web page of Cauli-Wood Gallery in mobile and desktop versions. In the mobile version, the gallery and description are displayed one below the other. In the desktop version, the navigation list is displayed below the page header, the article about the page is displayed at the left pane, and the links for the upcoming shows are displayed at the right pane.

<h2><sup><em>Figure 5-64</em></sup></h2>
<p>Sofia has already written much of the HTML code and some of the styles to be used in this project. Your job will be to finish the redesign and present her with the final version of the page.</p>
<h2>Document Setup</h2>
<p>Open the <em>cw_home.html</em> and <em>cw_styles.css</em>files and enter your <strong>name</strong> and the <strong>date</strong> in the comment section of each file. Next, go to the <em>cw_home.html</em> file and within the document <code>head</code>, insert a <code>meta</code> element that sets the browser <code>viewport</code> for use with mobile devices. Also, create links to <em>cw_reset.css</em> and <em>cw_styles.css</em> style sheets. Take some time to study the contents and structure of the document and then close the file. Return to the <em>cw_styles.css</em> file and at the top of the file, use the <code>@import</code> rule to import the contents of the <em>cw_designs.css</em> file, which contains several style rules that format the appearance of different page elements.</p>
<h2>Home Page Styles</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the home page is a navigation list with the ID <code>bottom</code>containing several <code>ul</code> elements. Sofia wants these <code>ul</code> elements laid out side-by-side. Create a style rule for the <code>nav#bottom</code> selector displaying its element as a flexbox row with no wrapping. Set the <code>justify-content</code> property so that the flex items are centered along the main axis. For the <code>nav#bottom ul</code>selector, create a style rule to set the flex growth rate to <strong>0</strong>, the shrink rate to <strong>1</strong>, and the basis value to <strong>150</strong> pixels.</p>
<p>Sofia wants more highly contrasting colors when the page is displayed in a mobile device. Create a media query for mobile screen devices with maximum widths of <strong>480</strong> pixels. Within that media query, insert a style rule that sets the font color of the <code>body</code> element to <strong>rgb(211, 211, 211)</strong> and sets the <code>body</code> background color to <strong>rgb(51, 51, 51)</strong>.</p>
<p>Sofia also wants to reduce the clutter in the mobile version of the home page. Hide the following elements for mobile users: the <code>aside</code> element, any <code>img</code> element within the <code>article</code> element, and the spotlight <code>section</code> element.</p>
<p>At the top of the web page is a navigation list with the ID <code>top</code>. For mobile devices, create a style rule for the <code>nav#top ul</code>selector, displaying the element as a flexbox row with wrapping. For each list item within the <code>nav#top ul</code> selector, set the font size to <strong>2.2em</strong>. Size the list items by setting their flex values to <strong>1</strong> for the growth and shrink rates and <strong>130</strong> pixels for the basis value.</p>
<p>Under the mobile layout, the six list items in the top navigation list should appear as square blocks with different background images. Using the selector <code>nav#top ul li:nth-of-type(1)</code> for the first list item, create a style rule that changes the background to the background image <em>cw_image01.png</em>. Center the background image with no tiling and size it so that the entire image is contained within the background.</p>
<p>Repeat the previous step for the next five list items using the same general format. Use the <em>cw_image02.png</em> file for background of the second list item, the <em>cw_image03.png</em> file for the third list item background, and so forth up through the <code>nav#top ul li:nth-of-type(6)</code>selector.</p>
<h2>Format Mobile Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>Sofia has placed hypertext links for the gallery&rsquo;s phone number and e-mail address in a paragraph with the ID <code>links</code>. For mobile users, she wants these two hypertext links spaced evenly within the paragraph that is displayed below the top navigation list. To format these links, create a style rule that displays the element referenced by the <code>p#links</code> selector as a flexbox row with no wrapping, then add a style that sets the value of the <code>justify-content</code> property to <code>space-around</code>. She wants the telephone and e-mail links to be prominently displayed on mobile devices. For each <code>p#links</code> a selector, apply the following style rule that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>displays the link text in <strong>white</strong> on the background color <strong>rgb(220, 27, 27)</strong>,</li>
    <li>sets the border radius around each hypertext to <strong>20</strong> pixels with <strong>10</strong> pixels of padding, and</li>
    <li>removes any underlining from the hypertext links.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tablet and Desktop Layouts</h2>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll define the layout for tablet and desktop devices. Create a media query for screen devices whose <code>width</code> is <strong>481</strong> pixels or greater. Within this media query, display the <code>body</code> element as a flexbox in row orientation with wrapping. The page <code>body</code>has four children: the <code>header</code>, the <code>footer</code>, the <code>article</code> element, and the <code>aside</code> element. The <code>article</code> and <code>aside</code> elements will share a row with more space given to the <code>article</code>element. Set the flex growth, shrink, and basis values of the <code>article</code> element to <strong>2</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, and <strong>400</strong> pixels. Set those same flex values for the <code>aside</code> element to <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, and <strong>200</strong> pixels.</p>
<p>For tablet and desktop devices, the top navigation list should be displayed as a horizontal row with no wrapping. Enter a style rule for the <code>nav#top ul</code> selector to display that element as a flexbox with a background color of <strong>rgb(51, 51, 51)</strong> and a <code>height</code> of <strong>50</strong> pixels. Use the <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>property to center the flex items within that flexbox both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>For the <code>nav#top ul li</code> selector, create a style rule for those list items, setting the flex growth rate to <strong>0</strong>, the flex shrink rate to <strong>1</strong>, and the basis value to <strong>80</strong> pixels.</p>
<p>Sofia doesn&rsquo;t want the <code>links</code> paragraph displayed for tablet and desktop devices. Complete the media query for tablet and desktop devices by creating a style rule for the <code>p#links</code> selector to hide the paragraph.</p>
<p>Verify that the layout and contents of the page switch between the mobile version and the tablet/desktop version shown in <em>Figure 5&ndash;64</em> as the screen width is increased and decreased.</p>
