Do the following:
## Tasks

Open the *code4-4.html* and *debug4-4.css* files and in the comment section enter your **name** (First + Last) and the **date** (MM/DD/YYYY) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields of each file.

Go to the *code4-4.html* file and within the ```head``` section insert a ```link``` element that links the page to the *debug4-4.css* style sheet file.

Go to the *debug4-4.css* file in your browser. The first style rule adds two text shadows to the ```h1``` heading: a dark **brown**shadow and a **white** highlight. The shadows are not appearing in the web page. Locate and fix the syntax error in this style rule.

The next style rule was written to add a box shadow to the ```article``` element that has an offset of **0** pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions, blur radius of **30** pixels and size value of **5** pixels. Fix the syntax errors in this style rule.

The next style rule creates a border image for the ```article``` element using a linear gradient for the image. Fix the syntax error in this style rule.

The final style rule defines the background for the ```article``` element consisting of:
        
1. A radial gradient going from **white** circle located near the top left corner of the background, to semi-transparent **yellow**, semi-transparent **brown**, and semi-transparent **ochre**.
2. A sketch by Michelangelo located in the lower right corner sized at **75%** of the ```width``` of the element.
3. An ivory-colored background fill. There are several syntax errors in the code. Locate and fix all of the errors.
        
Open the website in the browser preview and verify that design of the page resembles that shown in *Figure 4-67*.
