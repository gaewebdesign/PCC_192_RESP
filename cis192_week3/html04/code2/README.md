**Tasks**

Open the file *code4-2.html* and *code4-2_grad.css* and in the comment section enter your **name** **(First + Last**) and the **date**(**MM/DD/YYYY**) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields of each file.

Go to the *code4-2.html* file and within the ```head``` section insert a ```link``` element linking the page to the *code4-2_grad.css* file.

Open the *code4-2_grad.css* file. Create a style rule for the ```article``` element that adds a black inset box shadow with a horizontal and vertical offset of **0** pixels, a blur radius of **50** pixels and a size of **20** pixels.

Create a style rule for the ```article``` element that sets the radius of the border corners to **150** pixels.

Add the following multiple backgrounds:

1. A background containing the image file *landscape.png*placed with no tiling at the bottom right corner of the element with a size of **100%**.
2. A linear gradient at an angle of **165** degrees that goes from **black** to the color value **rgb(0, 0, 200)** with a color stop of **65%**, to **rgb(211, 0, 55)** with a color stop of **75%**, to **orange** with a color stop of **80%**, and finally to **yellow** with a color stop of **82%**.

While working in the the *code4-2_grad.css* file, create a style rule for ```h1``` and ```h2``` elements that adds a **white** text shadow **2** pixels above and to the left of the text with a blur radius of **3** pixels.

Create a style rule for paragraphs that adds a **red** text shadow **2** pixels down and to the right of the text with a blur radius of **3** pixels.

Open the page in your browser and verify that the design resembles that shown in *Figure 4-65*.
