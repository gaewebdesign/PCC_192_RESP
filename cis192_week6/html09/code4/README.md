Do the following:
## Tasks
Open the files *code9-4.html* and *debug9-4.js* and in the comment section enter your **name** (First + Last) and the **date** (MM/DD/YYYY) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields of each file.

Open the *code9-4.html* file. There is a mistake in the ```script``` element in that the external JavaScript will be opened and run before the page is completely loaded. Fix the script element so that it loads the script file only once the page is loaded.

Open the *debug9-4.js* file. The slide images should update every **5** seconds. Fix the parameter values for the ```setInterval()``` method so that the ```showImage()``` function is run every **5** seconds.

There are several mistakes in the code in which items that should be quoted are not. Locate and fix those errors.

Use of uppercase and lowercase letters is another source of error. Find and fix all situations in which variable names or JavaScript commands are written with improper case.

Open the website in the browser preview. When the page is free of errors, you should see a random image every 5 seconds. If the page is not working, you can use the Developer tools in your browser to locate any errors remaining in the code.
