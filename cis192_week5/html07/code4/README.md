Do the following:

Open the file *code7-4.html* and in the comment section enter your **name** (First + Last) and the **date** (MM/DD/YYYY) into the ```Author:``` and ```Date:``` fields.

Open *code7-4.html* file and within the ```head``` section insert a ```link``` element linking the page to the *code7-4_forms.css*.

Within the *code7-4.html* file locate and fix the errors in the page so that the file passes validation with no errors or warnings. Note that some of the same errors are repeated multiple times throughout the HTML code.

The ```for``` attribute for some of the labels is incorrect! Make sure attribute matches the corresponding ```input``` or ```select``` id.
